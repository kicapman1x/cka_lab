Modify the existing web-gateway on cka5673 namespace to handle HTTPS traffic on port 443 for kodekloud.com, using a TLS certificate stored in a secret named kodekloud-tls.

Is the web gateway configured to listen on the hostname kodekloud.com?

Is the HTTPS listener configured with the correct TLS certificate?
