A pod called pink-pod-cka16-trb is created in the default namespace in cluster4. This app runs on port tcp/5000, and it is to be exposed to end-users using an ingress resource called pink-ing-cka16-trb such that it becomes accessible using the command curl http://kodekloud-pink.app on the cluster4-controlplane host. There is an ingress.yaml file under the root folder in cluster4-controlplane. Create an ingress resource by following the command and continue with the task.
