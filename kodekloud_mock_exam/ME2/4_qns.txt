One application, webpage-server-01, is deployed on the Kubernetes cluster by the Helm tool in default namespace. Now, the team wants to deploy a new version of the application by replacing the existing one. A new version of the helm chart is given in the /root/new-version directory on the cluster1-controlplane. Validate the chart before installing it on the Kubernetes cluster.

Use the helm command to validate and install the chart. After successfully installing the newer version, uninstall the older version.
