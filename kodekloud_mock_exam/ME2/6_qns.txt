Deploy a Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) named analytics-vpa for a deployment named analytics-deployment in the cka24456 namespace. The VPA should automatically adjust the CPU and memory requests of the pods to optimize resource utilization. Ensure that the VPA operates in Auto mode, allowing it to evict and recreate pods with updated resource requests as needed.

#VPA tested meh walao
