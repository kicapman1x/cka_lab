We have deployed a 2-tier web application on the cluster3 nodes in the canara-wl05 namespace. However, at the moment, the web app pod cannot establish a connection with the MySQL pod successfully.

You can check the status of the application from the terminal by running the curl command with the following syntax:

curl http://cluster3-controlplane:NODE-PORT

To make the application work, create a new secret called db-secret-wl05 with the following key values: -

1. DB_Host=mysql-svc-wl05
2. DB_User=root
3. DB_Password=password123

Next, configure the web application pod to load the new environment variables from the newly created secret.

Note: Check the web application again using the curl command, and the status of the application should be success.
