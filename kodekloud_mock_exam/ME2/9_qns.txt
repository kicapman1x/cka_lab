John is setting up a two-tier application stack that is supposed to be accessible using the service curlme-cka01-svcn. To test that the service is accessible, he is using a pod called curlpod-cka01-svcn. However, at the moment, he is unable to get any response from the application.

Troubleshoot and fix this issue so the application stack is accessible.

You may delete and recreate the service curlme-cka01-svcn if needed.
