The deployment called web-dp-cka17-trb has 0 out of 1 pods up and running. Troubleshoot this issue and fix it. Make sure all required POD(s) are in running state and stable (not restarting).

The application runs on port 80 inside the container and is exposed on the node port 30090.

Are POD(s) running and stable?

Are the Issues fixed?
