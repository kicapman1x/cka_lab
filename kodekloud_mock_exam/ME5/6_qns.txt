On cluster3, there is a web application pod running inside the default namespace. This pod is part of a deployment called webapp-color-wl10 and uses an environment variable that can change constantly. Add this environment variable to a configmap and configure the pod in the deployment to make use of this config map.

Use the following specs-


1. Create a new configMap called webapp-wl10-config-map with the key and value as - APP_COLOR=red.

2. Update the deployment to make use of the newly created configMap name.

3. Delete and recreate the deployment if necessary.




Is the deployment created with a configmap?

Is configMap created correctly?
