In the cka-multi-containers namespace, proceed to create a pod named cka-sidecar-pod that adheres to the following specifications:

    The first container, labeled main-container, is required to run the nginx:1.27, which writes the current date along with a greeting message Hi I am from Sidecar container to /log/app.log.
    The second container, identified as sidecar-container, must use the nginx:1.25 image and serve the app.log file as a webpage located at /usr/share/nginx/html.


Note: Do not rename app.log to index.html. The file name should remain app.log and be available at /app.log via the nginx server.

Check the actual log file inside the container

Check the same file via the sidecar container
