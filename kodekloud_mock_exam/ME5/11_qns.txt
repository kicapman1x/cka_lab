A Kustomize configuration is located at /root/web-dashboard-kustomize on cluster2-controlplane. This application is designed to monitor the pods in the default namespace. It has been deployed using the following command:

kubectl kustomize /root/web-dashboard-kustomize/overlays/dev | kubectl apply -f -

The application is currently unable to monitor the pods due to insufficient permissions. Modify the Kustomize overlays/dev configuration to ensure the application is operational.

The application is currently unable to monitor the pods due to insufficient permissions. Adjust the Kustomize configuration accordingly to ensure the application is operational.

Is Kustomize configuration fixed?

Is the application ready?
