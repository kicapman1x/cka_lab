There is a deployment nginx-deployment-cka04-svcn in cluster3 which is exposed using service nginx-service-cka04-svcn.



Create an ingress resource nginx-ingress-cka04-svcn to load balance the incoming traffic with the following specifications:


pathType: Prefix and path: /

Backend Service Name: nginx-service-cka04-svcn

Backend Service Port: 80

ssl-redirect is set to false


Is the "nginx-ingress-cka04-svcn" ingress resource created?

Is PathType: "Prefix"?

Is Path: "/"?

Is Backend serviceName: "nginx-service-cka04-svcn"?

Is Backend servicePort: "80"?

Is "ssl-redirect" is set to "false"?

Is ingress working?
