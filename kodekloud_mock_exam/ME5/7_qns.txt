One co-worker deployed a KubeSphere NGINX helm chart on the cluster1 server called lvm-crystal-apd. A new update is pushed to the helm chart, and the team wants you to update the helm repository to fetch the new changes.


After updating the helm chart, upgrade its version to 1.3.4 and increase the replica count to 3.


NOTE: - We have to perform this task on the cluster1-controlplane node.


You can SSH into the cluster1 using ssh cluster1-controlplane command.

Is deployment running?

Is the chart version upgraded?

Is the deployment scaled?
