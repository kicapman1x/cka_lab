Create an HPA named webapp-hpa for a deployment named webapp-deployment in the default namespace with service webapp-service associated to it.

The HPA should scale the deployment based on CPU utilization, maintaining an average CPU usage of 50% across all pods with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 3 replicas.

Configure the HPA to scale down pods cautiously by setting a stabilization window of 300 seconds to prevent rapid fluctuations in pod count.

Check if HPA targets the correct deployment

Check if HPA has CPU target set to 50%

Check if HPA has scale-down stabilization window set to 300s

Check if HPA has minimum replicas set to 1

Check if HPA has maximum replicas set to 3
