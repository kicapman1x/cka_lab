We have a deployment named external-app and a service associated with it named external-service in the external namespace already created.

There is also an existing Ingress resource named external-ingress in the external namespace.

Create HTTPRoute to achieve the same behavior as external-ingress.

Part 1

    Create an HTTP Gateway named web-gateway in the nginx-gateway namespace, which uses the nginx gateway class, and listens on port 80, and allows routes from all namespaces.

Part 2

    Create an HTTPRoute named external-route in the external namespace that binds to the web-gateway in the nginx-gateway namespace and routes traffic to the external-service in the external namespace.

Part 3

    Remove the existing Ingress resource from the external namespace.

Hit curl on the gateway to test the service.

# This is the node port where gatewayclass is attached to
curl localhost:30080


Is HTTPRoute references the correct gateway namespace and service?

Is the gateway created and is it in the nginx-gateway namespace?

Is HTTPRoute linked to service in the external namespace?

Is Gatewayclass configured correctly?

Is the deployment accessible through the gateway?

Is the ingress resource removed?
