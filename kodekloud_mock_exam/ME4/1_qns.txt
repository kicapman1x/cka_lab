A template to create a Kubernetes pod is stored at /root/red-probe-cka12-trb.yaml on the cluster1-controlplane. However, using this template as is resulting in an error.

Fix the issue with this template and use it to create the pod. Once created, watch the pod for a minute or two to ensure it is stable, i.e., it's not crashing or restarting.

Do not update the args: section of the template.

Is the template fixed and applied?

Is the POD stable?

Is the template not manipulated?
