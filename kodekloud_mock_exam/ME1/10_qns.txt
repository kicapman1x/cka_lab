In the dev-wl07 namespace, one of the developers has performed a rolling update and upgraded the application to a newer version. But somehow, application pods are not being created.

To get back the working state, rollback the application to the previous version .

After rolling the deployment back, on the cluster1-controlplane node, save the image currently in use to the /root/rolling-back-record.txt file and increase the replica count to 5.
