On the cluster2-controlplane, a Helm chart repository is given under the /opt/ path. It contains the files that describe a set of Kubernetes resources that can be deployed as a single unit. The files have some issues. Fix those issues and deploy them with the following specifications: -

    The release name should be webapp-color-apd.
    All the resources should be deployed on the frontend-apd namespace.
    The service type should be node port.
    Scale the deployment to 3.
    Application version should be 1.20.0.

NOTE: - Remember to make necessary changes in the values.yaml and Chart.yaml files according to the specifications, and, to fix the issues, inspect the template files.
