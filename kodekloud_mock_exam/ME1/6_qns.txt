Create an HTTPRoute named web-route in the nginx-gateway namespace that directs traffic from the web-gateway to a backend service named web-service on port 80 and ensures that the route is applied only to requests with the hostname cluster2-controlplane.

To test the configuration, run the following command:

curl http://cluster2-controlplane:30080
