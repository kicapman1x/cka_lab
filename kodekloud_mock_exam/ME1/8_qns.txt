Create an nginx pod called nginx-resolver-cka06-svcn using the image nginx, and expose it internally with a service called nginx-resolver-service-cka06-svcn.

Test that you are able to look up the service and pod names from within the cluster. Use the image busybox:1.28 for dns lookup. Record results in /root/CKA/nginx.svc.cka06.svcn and /root/CKA/nginx.pod.cka06.svcn on cluster1-controlplane.
