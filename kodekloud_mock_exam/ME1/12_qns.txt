Use the following specs for the deployment:

1. Replica count should be 3.

2. Set the Max Unavailable to 40% and Max Surge to 55%.

3. Create the deployment and ensure all the pods are ready.

4. After successful deployment, upgrade the deployment image to kodekloud/webapp-color:v2 and inspect the deployment rollout status.

5. Check the rolling history of the deployment, and on the cluster1-controlplane, save the current revision count number to the /opt/revision-count.txt file.

6. Finally, perform a rollback and revert the deployment image to the older version.
