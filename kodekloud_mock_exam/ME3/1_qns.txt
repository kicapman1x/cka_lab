One of our Junior DevOps engineers has deployed a pod nginx-wl06 on the cluster3-controlplane node. However, while specifying the resource limits, instead of using Mebibyte as the unit, Gebibyte was used.

As a result, the node doesn't have sufficient resources to deploy this pod, and it is stuck in a pending state

Fix the units and re-deploy the pod with about 100Mi (Delete and recreate the pod if needed).

Is the Pod running?

Is the memory fixed?
