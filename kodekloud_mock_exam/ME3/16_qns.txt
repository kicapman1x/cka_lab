An nginx-based pod called cyan-pod-cka28-trb is running under the cyan-ns-cka28-trb namespace and is exposed within the cluster using the cyan-svc-cka28-trb service.

This is a restricted pod, so a network policy called cyan-np-cka28-trb has been created in the same namespace to apply some restrictions on this pod.


Two other pods called cyan-white-cka28-trb and cyan-black-cka28-trb are also running in the default namespace.


The nginx-based app running on the cyan-pod-cka28-trb pod is exposed internally on the default nginx port (80).


Expectation: This app should only be accessible from the cyan-white-cka28-trb pod.


Problem: This app is not accessible from anywhere.


Troubleshoot this issue and fix the connectivity as per the requirement listed above.


Note: You can exec into cyan-white-cka28-trb and cyan-black-cka28-trb pods and test connectivity using the curl utility.


You may update the network policy, but make sure it is not deleted from the cyan-ns-cka28-trb namespace.
