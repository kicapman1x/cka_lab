Part I:

Create a ClusterIP service with name of service-3421-svcn in the spectra-1267 namespace, which should expose the pods, namely, pod-23 and pod-21, with port set to 8080 and targetport to 80.

Part II:

Store the pod names and their IP addresses from the spectra-1267 namespace at /root/pod_ips_cka05_svcn where the output is sorted by their IPs.

Please ensure the format as shown below:

POD_NAME        IP_ADDR
pod-1           ip-1
pod-3           ip-2
pod-2           ip-3
...


Does "service-3421-svcn" exist?

Is service-3421-svcn of "type: ClusterIP"?

Is port: 8080?

Is targetPort: 80?

Does service only expose pod "pod-23" and "pod-21"?

Is the correct and sorted output stored in "/root/pod_ips_cka05_svcn"?
