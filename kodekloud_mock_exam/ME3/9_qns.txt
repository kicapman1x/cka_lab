Configure a web-portal-httproute within the cka3658 namespace to facilitate traffic distribution. Route 80% of the traffic to web-portal-service-v1 and 20% to the new version, web-portal-service-v2.

Note: Gateway has already been created in the nginx-gateway namespace.
To test the gateway, execute the following command:

curl http://cluster2-controlplane:30080

Is the HttpRoute referring to the NGINX gateway?

Is the web-portal-httproute routing 80% traffic to web-portal-service-v1?

Is the web-portal-httproute routing 20% traffic to web-portal-service-v2?

Is the web-portal-httproute distributing traffic?
