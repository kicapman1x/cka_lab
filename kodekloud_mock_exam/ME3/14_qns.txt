We have an external webserver running on student-node which is exposed at port 9999. We have created a service called external-webserver-cka03-svcn that can connect to our local webserver from within the kubernetes cluster3, but at the moment, it is not working as expected.

Fix the issue so that other pods within cluster3 can use external-webserver-cka03-svcn service to access the webserver.

Can the pod within cluster3 access the external webserver?

Does the external-webserver-cka03-svcn service have the correct IP addresses listed as endpoints?

Is the correct port specified?
