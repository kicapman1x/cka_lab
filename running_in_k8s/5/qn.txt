From a three-node cluster, cordon one of the worker nodes. Schedule a Pod without a nodeSelector. Uncordon the worker node and edit the Pod, applying a new node name to the YAML (set it to the node that was just uncordoned). After replacing the YAML, see if the Pod is scheduled to the recently uncordoned node.

Start a basic nginx Deployment; remove the taint from the control plane node so that Pods donâ€™t need a toleration to be scheduled to it. Add a nodeSelector to the Pod spec within the Deployment, and see if the Pod is now running on the control plane node.
