In cluster ik8s, in a namespace called db08328, create a Deployment with the kubectl command line (imperatively) named mysql, with the image mysql:8. List the Pods in the db08328 namespace to see if the Pod is running. If the Pod is not running, view the logs to determine why the Pod is not in a healthy state. Once youâ€™ve collected the necessary log information, make changes to the Pod to fix it and get it back to a running, healthy state
