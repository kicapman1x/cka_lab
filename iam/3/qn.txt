Create a new Service Account named secure-sa, and create a Pod that uses this Service Account. Make sure the token is not exposed to the Pod. Create a new cluster Role named acme-corp-role that will allow the create action on Deployments, replicates, and DaemonSets. Bind that cluster Role to the Service Account secure-sa and make sure the Service Account can only create the assigned resources within the default namespace and nowhere else. Use auth can-i to verify that the secure-sa Service Account cannot create Deployments in the kube-system namespace, and output the result of the command plus the command itself to a file and share that file.
